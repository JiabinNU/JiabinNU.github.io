## Robotic Design Studio (RDS)
![](../images/slides.PNG) [Demo Slides]()

Our group design an uneven bar gynmastic robot:
- Complete mechanical and electrical design of a three link robot
  * Top link is "hand", use pancake motor driven by ESC to grab the bar
  * Middle part is "muscles", contains two brushless motors driven by amplifier to rotate between links
  * Bottom part is "brain", contains E-stop, battery, Relay, two Roboteq amplifier.

- MatLab simulation of Giant Swing and release-catch
  * Use Euler-Lagrange equations to build the frame of a triple pendulum, simulate the swing and collision phase
  * Use energy-shape controller to pump up the robot
  * Use the position and velocity of the centroid to determine the time of releasing
